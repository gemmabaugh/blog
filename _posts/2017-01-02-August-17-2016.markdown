I was chugging along on my bike, determined to get home but slowing at the end of my ride. So, instead of boldly gliding into the street as I would have usually, I opted to stay on the sidewalk. Speeding toward the intersection of 116th and Rangeline Rd, I checked the light---green---and headed for the crosswalk without a second thought. Only once I was in the road, crossing Rangeline without hesitation, did I notice a sedan in the oncoming traffic driving toward me. Somehow, in the next few seconds, my mind raced through several of the five stages of grief---specifically, denial, "Oh I'm sure they'll stop, they have to see me," to bargaining, "Do I stop or keep going? Maybe if I keep going he won't hit me. Please OH," to acceptance, "SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK SHIT." With each stage, time seemed to degrade, reality slipping into slow motion all around me. Acceptance hit as the car slammed into my left side, expelling the air from my lungs and throwing me from my bicycle to a world spinning around me in glimpses, my eyes adjusting to alternating flashes of car tires and the pavement looming inches from my face. Acceptance continued all the way to the middle of the road where I landed, sprawled out flat, staring up at the sky, the yellow line between lanes drawing a midline down my back.
