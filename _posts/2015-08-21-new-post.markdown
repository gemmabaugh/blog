notes on how to get here

open Emacs
access file directory thingy
to access file you want to change:
type M-x eshell (M is alt button)

eshell notes:
cd [some directory] (change to that directory)
cd .. (go up a directory)
ls (list files)
rm (remove file, doesn't go to recycle bin, deletes immediately)
rm -r (very dangerous!!! remove everything in directory)
jekyll serve (in ~/Documents/GitHub/gemmabaugh.github.io will serve the website locally/on my computer for previewing before publishing)

helpful emacs notes:
C-g (quits from anything running, useful if weird things happen)
M = alt
C = ctrl
C-x 1 = close other windows that aren't selected
C-x C-s = save
M-x ffap = opens url or file name wherever cursor is located (useful when opening local url when using jekyll serve)
