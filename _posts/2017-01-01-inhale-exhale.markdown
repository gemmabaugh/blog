You're standing on a bed of moss, surrounded by big brown tree trunks topped with leaves in every shape and size, while a bright blue sky and beams of sunshine peek through the branches. Take a deep breath. Next, you're in the middle of an icy tundra, bundled up in the warmest winter gear and with each inhale your lungs are filled with a refreshing burst of chilly oxygen. Now, you're facing out to the ocean, standing knee deep in aquamarine waves while a gentle breeze flows across your cheeks and along your neck. What do you get in each of these scenes? What's the precious, life-sustaining elixir that makes it all possible? Fresh air, nature's gift! Please breathe responsibly.
